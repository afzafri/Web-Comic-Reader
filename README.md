# Web Comic Reader
Web Based cbr/cbz/cbt comic book reader. Written in HTML5 and Javascript (with jQuery) <br>
Demo: https://afzafri.github.io/Web-Comic-Reader/

***9/28/2023 update

I updated the index.html file to use PHP and JS to scan the Comics folder, create and sort a list of files in the Comics folder, and create buttons that open the files.
With my testing, this gets around the upload file size limit on the "Choose file from your Compter" tab.  Refreshing the page automatically repopulates the list on the "Open file stored in the server" tab.
