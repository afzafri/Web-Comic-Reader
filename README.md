## Usage

### Library Mode (Recommended)
1. Click "Select Comics Folder"
2. Choose your comics folder and grant permission
3. Browse your library with thumbnails and progress tracking
4. Click any comic to read
5. Your progress is automatically saved

### Quick Read Mode
1. Click "Quick Read"
2. Upload a single CBR/CBZ/CBT file
3. Read immediately (progress won't be saved)

## Getting Started (Development)

### Prerequisites
- A local web server (Python's `http.server`, Node's `http-server`, etc.)
- For Library Mode: HTTPS server setup

### Basic Setup (HTTP - Quick Read Only)
```bash
# Clone or download the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Web-Comic-Reader

# Start a local server (choose one):
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Node.js http-server
npx http-server -p 8000

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Only Quick Read mode will work.

### HTTPS Setup (Required for Library Mode)

To enable Library Mode with folder access, you need HTTPS:

**Option 1: Using nginx-proxy (Recommended for local development)**
1. Set up nginx-proxy with SSL certificates
2. Configure proxy to your local server
3. Access via `https://yourdomain.test`

**Option 2: Using mkcert for local HTTPS**
```bash
# Install mkcert
# macOS
brew install mkcert

# Create local CA
mkcert -install

# Generate certificate
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1

# Use with your server (example with http-server)
npx http-server -p 8000 -S -C localhost+1.pem -K localhost+1-key.pem
```

### Development Notes
- Reading progress is stored in `localStorage` (key: `comic_reader_userpref`)
- Folder handles are stored in `IndexedDB` (database: `ComicReaderDB`)
- Thumbnails are base64-encoded JPEG stored in localStorage
- lightGallery v1 still requires jQuery as a dependency

## Requirements

- Modern browser with File System Access API support (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- **HTTPS required** for Library Mode (folder access)
- For Quick Read Mode, HTTP is sufficient

## Supported Formats

- `.cbr` - Comic Book RAR
- `.cbz` - Comic Book ZIP
- `.cbt` - Comic Book TAR

## Technical Details

- Pure client-side processing (no server required)
- Reading progress stored in localStorage
- Folder handles stored in IndexedDB
- Thumbnails generated using Canvas API
- lightGallery for image viewing with zoom and fullscreen
